# Stock Price Prediction Model
**The model achieved an accuracy of _56%_ on the last 100 rows of a dataset.**

The model has been trained on historical stock price data truncated at 2001-08-05. The stock in the example, **'ED'** *(ConEdison)*, was chosen due to its low volatility and predictable seasonal swings.

The effectiveness of the model is based on whether it's able to predict the following day's closing price of a stock correctly.
